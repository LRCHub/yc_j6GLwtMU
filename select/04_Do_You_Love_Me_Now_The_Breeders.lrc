[00:00.13] If I saw you now
[00:07.52] Could I look in your eyes?
[00:19.97] Do you think of me
[00:27.09] Like I dream of you?
[00:34.70] Do you wish you were here
[00:41.32] Like I wish I was with you?
[00:54.82] 
[00:47.12] You've loved me before
[00:51.73] Do you love me now?
[01:01.23] 
[00:59.40] Does love ever end
[01:06.90] When two hearts have torn away?
[01:13.86] Or does it go on
[01:20.96] And beat strong anyway?
[01:32.46] 
[01:26.15] You've loved me before
[01:31.51] Do you love me now?
[01:41.01] 
[01:37.47] Come back to me right now
[01:44.42] C'mon, c'mon, come back to me right now
[02:03.92] 
[02:23.93] C'mon, c'mon, come back to me right now
[02:31.34] C'mon, c'mon, come on
[02:41.84] 
[02:34.34] You've loved me before
[02:39.01] Do you love me now?
[02:48.51] 
[02:44.75] You've loved me before
[02:49.39] Do you love me now?
