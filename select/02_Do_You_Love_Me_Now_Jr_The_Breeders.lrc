[00:00.47] If I saw you now
[00:07.70] Could I look in your eyes?
[00:20.70] 
[00:16.35] Do you think of me
[00:26.69] Like I dream of you?
[00:36.69] 
[00:33.52] Do you wish you were here
[00:40.27] Like I wish I was with you?
[00:53.77] 
[00:47.05] You've loved me before
[00:52.53] Do you love me now?
[01:02.03] 
[00:58.37] Does love ever end
[01:05.59] When two hearts have torn away?
[01:11.90] Or does it go on
[01:19.19] And beat strong anyway?
[01:25.94] You've loved me before
[01:31.38] Do you love me now?
[01:40.88] 
[01:37.26] Come back to me right now!
[01:44.07] C'mon c'mon come back to me right now!
[02:03.07] 
[02:07.12] C'mon c'mon come back to me right now!
[02:30.70] C'mon c'mon come on!
[02:40.70] 
[02:34.32] You've loved me before
[02:37.97] Do you love me now?
[02:47.47] 
[02:44.74] You've loved me before
[02:48.34] Do you love me now?
